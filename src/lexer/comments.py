2.7 Comments

The characters /* start a comment, which terminates with the characters */. These comments do not nest. The characters // start a comment, which terminates immediately before the next new-line character. If there is a form-feed or a vertical-tab character in such a comment, only white-space characters shall appear between it and the new-line that terminates the comment; no diagnostic is required. [ Note: The comment characters //, /*, and */ have no special meaning within a // comment and are treated just like other characters. Similarly, the comment characters // and /* have no special meaning within a /* comment.
