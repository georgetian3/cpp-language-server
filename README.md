# CPP-Language-Server

## Lexer

The lexer was implemented using PLY.

### Usage

No external dependencies need to be installed. PLY is saved under `/src/ply`.

Under the `src` folder, execute: `py src/main.py -i source_file.cpp -o token_stream.txt`

To visualize the tokens, open `/output/output.html` in your browser.
